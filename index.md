I'm a Senior iOS Developer and have extensive experience working on a variety of apps with large bases such as [Red Bull TV](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/red-bull-tv/id364269164?mt=8), [USPS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/usps-mobile/id339597578?mt=8), and [GateGuru](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gateguru-airport-info-flight/id326862399?mt=8).

In my spare time I do some [tech editing](https://www.raywenderlich.com/about#jahmad) and writing at RayWenderlich.com.
